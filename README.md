# MindSweep_Game
The Java Minesweeper game is text-based, featuring a 10x10 grid with 15 randomly placed mines. Players uncover cells by specifying coordinates, avoiding mines, and revealing hints indicating nearby mine counts. Winning requires revealing all safe cells, while hitting a mine leads to loss.
